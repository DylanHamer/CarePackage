# CarePackage Module 1.2
This is my coder base/module.
## Dependencies
Python 3.4

Click (optional, but without installation may make some functions unavailable.) - pip3 install click
## How to use
At the start of your program (or where ever you declare your imports) put in this line: `import CarePackage`

Just need a single function from the program? Do this instead: `from CarePackage import [FUNCTION HERE]`

Check out the wiki for info on functions and classes!

**Make sure the** `CarePackage.py` **file is in the same directory as your program!**

# CarePackage Terminal 1.1
This is a terminal you can have fun with when testing out some of the functions.

## Dependencies
CarePackage Module

**Make sure the** `CarePackage.py` **file is in the same directory as **`terminal.py`**!**
